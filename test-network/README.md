## Running the supply chain network

One can use the `./network.sh` script to stand up the simple supply chain Fabric network. The network has two peer
organizations (representing the retailer and manufacturer)
as well as a single node raft ordering service. You can also use the `./network.sh` script to create channels and deploy
chaincode.
